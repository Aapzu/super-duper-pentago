# Super Duper Pentago
Pentago is like Tic-Tac-Toe on steroids. The game created by Tomas Flod√©n is fast to learn, fast to play and very addicting.

This version is originally made as a basic programming practice work (Javalabra) in spring 2016 (University of Helsinki). The AI is implemented as a practice work on data structures and algorithms in spring 2017 (University of Helsinki).
