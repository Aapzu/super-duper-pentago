# Week 3
This week I’ve mostly been just been hacking a working package, which I think I’ve succeeded in. One can now play against a bot in GUI.
However, the bot is still really, really stupid. That’s something I will continue with next week.

### Program
The program has succeeded hugely. I’ve been writing tests and fixing little bugs in code. I’ve abstracted alpha-beta-pruning and added tests also for it. The test coverage (which I  also included this week as requested) is still not the best possible, but I’m going to increase it all the time from now on.

### What I've learnt?
I’ve learnt that tests are mandatory sometimes.

### What I haven't learnt yet and what I'm going to do next?
I said the bot works. However, that is not entirely true, –the bot only works when it only checks one move ahead. If set to go deeper, it completely freezes. Next I am going to investigate on the reason behind that. I’m constantly understanding game trees better.

### Time used
I used ~4h for the project this week.
