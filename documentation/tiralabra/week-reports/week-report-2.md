# Week 2
On this week I have been creating the heuristics and logic for alpha-beta pruning.

### Program
I’ve coded lot’s of help methods (e.g. copy-constructors) and heuristics. I documented all I wrote, but have not tested all of it yet. Heuristics have tests.

### What I've learnt?
I’ve learnt to write heuristics and (on some level) to write alpha-beta pruning as code.

### What I haven't learnt yet and what I'm going to do next?
The pruning is not working as expected, I have to get that to work next. Also next week I have to write many tests for e.g. Bot and AlphaBetaPruning.

### Time used
I used ~6h for the project this week.
