# Week 5
This week I'm late. I underestimated the time needed to implement own data structures, and didn't have time to fix all the bugs in my code. That's why I haven't done any performance testing yet (and accept the point loss because of that).

### Program
I now have own data structures. DynamicArray and ArrayUtils represent the functionalities of ArrayList and Arrays which I use in my code.

### What I've learnt?
Time. Coding requires time. (At least I need to focus on one project at the time)

### What I haven't learnt yet and what I'm going to do next?
I'm going to fix the bugs next. I found some quite big bugs, after fixing them the program should be mostly ready.

### Time used
I used about 8 hours on the project this week.
