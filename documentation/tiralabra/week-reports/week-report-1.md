# Week 1
On this week I have been familiarizing myself into the subject of AI and game trees and deciding whether to use this topic or not.

### Program
This week all the code I made is mostly just hashCode-methods, and making a bot to play with completely random (but legal) moves.

### What I've learnt?
I've learnt something about making a game-engine for simple board games, and how wide they are in some cases (in this case appr. 280^n, where n equals the number of moves calculated ahead).

### What I haven't learnt yet and what I'm going to do next?
I still haven't get completely familiar with the alpha-beta pruning, and how to implement it in Java, and how to write the heuristics for the game. The heuristics are the next thing I'm going to start making.

### Time used
I used quite alot for the project this week, ~8 hours I would say.
