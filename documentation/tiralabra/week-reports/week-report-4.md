# Week 4
This week I've mostly been implementing the serialization of the game modules to make the AlphaBetaPruning faster.

### Program
Serializations work now, the code is cleaner. I've also created all sorts of documentations into the repository.

### What I've learnt?
I learnt that one can not store endless amount of data into a single long.

### What I haven't learnt yet and what I'm going to do next?
Tests are broken now. That's the very next thing I have to continue with.

### Time used
The serialization and refactoring was so pain in the a$$ so it took me about 10h to do this week.
