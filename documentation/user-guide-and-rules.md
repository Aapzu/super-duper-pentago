## Rules Of The Game

Pentago board consists of 4 tiles in a square form, each of which has 9 squares in a square. So the board has 6x6 squares in 4 tiles.

The game has two players. One with black and on with white marbles. It doesn't matter, whom of the players starts.

On every turn, the player whose turn it is must put one of their marbles into one of the 36 squares and rotate one of the 4 tiles 90Â° into a direction of one's choice. The tile doesn't have to be the same, where the marble was just put in. After that the another player gets the turn and does the same with their marbles. However, the player is not allowed to rotate the same tile which was just rotated back to the opposite direction. Rotating the same tile to the same direction is allowed.

The winner is the player, who first gets 5 of their marbles in a row, horizontally, vertically or diagonally. If the board gets full without any of the players getting 5 in line, the game is tied, and an another on can be started.
